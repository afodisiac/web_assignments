how do we use bootstrap in html
Include Bootstrap CSS: Add the Bootstrap CSS stylesheet to your HTML file. You can either download Bootstrap and 
host it locally or link to the Bootstrap CDN (Content Delivery Network) in your HTML file's <head> section. Here's 
how you can include Bootstrap via CDN:
<head>
    <link href="https://cdn.jsdelivr.net/npm/bootstrap@5.3.0-alpha1/dist/css/bootstrap.min.css" rel="stylesheet">
</head>

Add Bootstrap JavaScript: If you plan to use Bootstrap's JavaScript components (like dropdowns, modals, etc.), include
 Bootstrap's JavaScript file before the closing </body> tag. Similar to the CSS, you can host it locally or use the CDN.
  Here's how to include Bootstrap's JavaScript via CDN:
  <body>
    <!-- Your HTML content here -->

    <script src="https://cdn.jsdelivr.net/npm/bootstrap@5.3.0-alpha1/dist/js/bootstrap.bundle.min.js"></script>
</body>

Use Bootstrap Classes: Once you've included Bootstrap, you can start using its predefined CSS classes in your HTML
 elements to apply styling and layout. For example, you can use classes like container, row, col, btn, alert, etc.,
  to style your content according to Bootstrap's design principles.
