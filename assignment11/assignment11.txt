what do the folloeing mean?
    dbhost:This parameter specifies the hostname or IP address of the database server. It tells the application where to 
find the database server on the network. For example, if your MySQL database server is hosted locally, the DB host 
might be "localhost". If it's hosted remotely, you would specify the server's IP address or domain name.
    dbuser:This parameter specifies the username used to authenticate the connection to the database server. This 
user should have the necessary privileges to perform the required operations on the database.
    dbname:This parameter specifies the name of the database to which you want to connect. Once connected, all SQL 
queries executed by the application will be performed within this database context.
    dbport: This parameter specifies the port number on which the database server is listening for connections. 
The default port for MySQL is 3306. If your database server is configured to listen on a different port, you would 
specify it here.
    dbpass:This parameter specifies the password used to authenticate the connection to the database server. It's 
important to keep this password secure and not hardcode it directly into your application code for security 
reasons. Instead, consider using environment variables or a configuration file.
