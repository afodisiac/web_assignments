how to declare variables in php

All variables in PHP are denoted with a leading dollar sign ($).
The value of a variable is the value of its most recent assignment.
Variables are assigned with the = operator, with the variable on the left-hand side and the expression to be evaluated on the right.
Variables can, but do not need, to be declared before assignment.
Variables in PHP do not have intrinsic types - a variable does not know in advance whether it will be used to store a number or a string of characters.
Variables used before they are assigned have default values.
PHP does a good job of automatically converting types from one to another when necessary.

Integers − are whole numbers, without a decimal point, like 4195.
Doubles − are floating-point numbers, like 3.14159 or 49.1.
Booleans − have only two possible values either true or false.
NULL − is a special type that only has one value: NULL.
Strings − are sequences of characters, like 'PHP supports string operations.'
Arrays − are named and indexed collections of other values.
Objects − are instances of programmer-defined classes, which can package up both other kinds of values and functions that are specific to the class.
Resources − are special variables that hold references to resources external to PHP (such as database connections).
